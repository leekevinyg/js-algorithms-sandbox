<h2>Same Tree</h2>

**Question**

Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

**Solution**

Run DFS, and print out the traversal order. If the order is the same, then they are the same tree.
